# Simple Todo
This repository is intended to be a very basic full-stack implementation of a todo list meant to serve as a coding exercise for interview candidates.

The following technologies are currently used and will likely need to be understood to complete the exercise:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Getting started
```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Your challenge
Your challenge, if you so choose to accept, shall be to implement the User Story below.

### User Story
```
As a user with todos,
I would like to mark todos as completed rather than deleting them,
So that I can see my old todos and understand how many todos are complete vs pending.
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Allow Todo's to me marked as complete
- Show to the user the # of completed Todo's

### Extras
Put your own spin on this repository if you feel inclined.. some ideas of things you might consider adding could be:
- Dockerize all the things
- Add better state management layer (Redux, Relay, etc)
- Add type checking (TypeScript, Flow, etc)
- Introduce a component library (Material, Bootstrap, etc)
- Style the FE
- Add tests
- Refactor to async/await
- Add JavaScript style checking (JSHint, ESLint, Prettier, etc)
- Add better error handling in Express
- Add a persistent store for Todos (Redis, MySQL, pSQL, etc)
- Add better logging
- Add a login
